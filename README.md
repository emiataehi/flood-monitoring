# Real-Time Flood Anomaly Detection System

This project presents a machine learning-driven flood monitoring system designed to detect and predict flood anomalies across three monitoring stations in Greater Manchester ‚Äî Bury Ground (River Irwell), Manchester Racecourse (River Irwell), and Rochdale (River Roch).

The system integrates real-time river level, rainfall, and meteorological data to detect potential flood risks using a hybrid ensemble approach that combines statistical analysis, Random Forest regression, and LSTM neural networks. It achieves over 97% accuracy in anomaly detection with sub-second response times, enabling near real-time alerts and decision support.

Interactive Streamlit App:https://floodmonitoringdashboardpy-w5atucr3y6mnjqzbwyfmyn.streamlit.app/

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview

The system continuously collects and processes data from multiple sources: 

- Real-time river and rainfall data from UK Environment Agency APIs (updated every 15 minutes)
- Historical hydrological and meteorological datasets for baseline modelling

***Supabase cloud database for real-time data ingestion, storage, and retrieval***

**Data is cleaned, standardized, and analyzed through a pipeline that includes:**

- Missing data handling (Random Forest imputation & mode imputation)
- Feature engineering (rolling statistics, lag features, rate-of-change)
- Z-score & interquartile range analysis for statistical anomaly detection
- ML-based anomaly prediction via Random Forest and LSTM models
- Ensemble weighting for adaptive anomaly scoring

The Streamlit dashboard visualizes live and historical trends, anomalies, and alert thresholds, while the backend processes new data with an average latency of 525ms.

## üß† Machine Learning Approach

| Model                   | Purpose                                | Key Metrics                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Random Forest Regressor | Detects abnormal river level patterns  | R¬≤ = 0.96                                           |
| LSTM Neural Network     | Predicts sequential water level trends | RMSE < 0.5                                          |
| Ensemble Method         | Combines Random Forest + LSTM outputs  | Accuracy = 97.7%, Precision = 95.5%, Recall = 94.9% |


Each station has its own trained models and dynamic thresholds to ensure local calibration of flood risk alerts.
